# Container Mode Limitations

This document outlines the current limitations and workarounds for the Claude GitHub webhook container execution mode.

## Current Implementation

The current implementation uses a hybrid approach:

1. **Repository Caching**: Repositories are still cloned and cached as designed, providing performance benefits for repeated queries.

2. **Custom Repository Analysis**: Instead of running Claude directly in the container (which encountered issues), we analyze repositories directly and generate helpful responses based on:
   - Repository structure
   - README content 
   - Pre-defined responses for known repositories
   - Technology detection with automatic summaries

3. **Fallback to Direct Mode**: For non-container mode, the service still uses the direct Claude Code CLI execution as originally intended.

## Execution Modes

You can configure the webhook service to operate in three different modes via the `CONTAINER_MODE` environment variable:

1. **`hybrid`** (default): Uses repository analysis first, and falls back to direct mode if that fails
2. **`direct`**: Always uses the direct Claude Code CLI execution
3. **`container`**: Only uses repository analysis without fallback

## Known Issues

### Container Output Capture

When executing Claude in a container, we encountered issues with capturing the output. Several approaches were attempted:

1. **Direct execSync**: Output not returned properly
2. **File-based output redirection**: Output file not created 
3. **Volume mounting**: Files not properly shared between container and host

These issues may be related to:
- Permission problems in the Docker environment
- Differences in user contexts between host and container
- Docker engine configuration
- Claude CLI output mechanism

### Container Execution Timeout

By default, containers have a 2-hour lifetime before being terminated. This can be configured via the `CONTAINER_LIFETIME_MS` environment variable (in milliseconds). For complex tasks requiring more time, you can increase this value.

### Claude Authentication

Another issue was authentication for the Claude CLI inside the container:

1. **API Key Issues**: Claude CLI could not authenticate properly with the provided API key
2. **Bedrock Credentials**: AWS credentials were passed but didn't work as expected

## Hybrid Approach Details

The hybrid execution mode implements the following workflow:

1. **Repository Analysis**:
   - Clone the repository (or use cached version)
   - Analyze directory structure
   - Identify technologies via common files (package.json, requirements.txt, etc.)
   - Parse README for description
   - Collect commit statistics
   
2. **Response Generation**:
   - Generate a structured Markdown summary of the repository
   - Analyze the command to determine intent (explanation, implementation, fix, etc.)
   - Create a tailored response that combines repository details with command context
   
3. **Known Repository Support**:
   - Configure `KNOWN_REPOSITORIES` environment variable with comma-separated list
   - Provide custom responses for frequently used repositories

4. **Fallback Mode**:
   - If repository analysis fails or if in hybrid mode, tries direct execution
   - The full fallback uses the original container-based execution approach
   - Always sanitizes responses to prevent infinite loops

## Future Improvements

To properly enable full Claude execution in containers, consider:

1. **Container Configuration**: 
   - Validate user/permission settings in Dockerfile
   - Ensure proper environment for Claude CLI execution

2. **Alternative Output Capture**:
   - Consider using named pipes 
   - Implement HTTP-based communication between container and host
   - Use Docker API directly instead of CLI commands

3. **Authentication**:
   - Pre-authenticate Claude CLI in the container image
   - Use persistent authentication volumes

4. **Alternative Approach**:
   - Consider using the Claude API directly instead of the CLI
   - Implement a lightweight API server inside the container

## Configuration Options

The hybrid approach can be configured using the following environment variables:

1. **`CONTAINER_MODE`**: Execution mode (`hybrid`, `direct`, or `container`)
2. **`REPO_CACHE_DIR`**: Directory to cache cloned repositories
3. **`KNOWN_REPOSITORIES`**: Comma-separated list of repositories that get special handling
4. **`CONTAINER_LIFETIME_MS`**: Maximum container runtime in milliseconds

## Testing

You can test the current implementation using the provided test utilities:

```bash
# Test with a repository (uses predefined response if known)
./test-container.js owner/repo "What is this repository about?"

# Test with any other repository (uses automatic analysis)
./test-container.js n8n-io/n8n "What is this repository about?"

# Test different modes
CONTAINER_MODE=direct ./test-container.js owner/repo "Analyze this repository"
CONTAINER_MODE=container ./test-container.js owner/repo "Explain the codebase"
```
