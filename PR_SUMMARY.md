# PR: Add Comprehensive CI/CD Pipeline with Automated PR Reviews

## 🚀 Summary

This PR implements a complete CI/CD pipeline with GitHub Actions, automated PR reviews, code quality tools, and security scanning.

## 🔧 Changes Made

### GitHub Actions Workflows
- **CI Pipeline** (`.github/workflows/ci.yml`)
  - Multi-stage testing (unit, integration, e2e)
  - ESLint code quality checks
  - Docker image building and testing
  - Automatic deployment to staging
  - Code coverage reporting

- **Security Scanning** (`.github/workflows/security.yml`)
  - Daily dependency vulnerability scans
  - Secret detection with TruffleHog
  - CodeQL static analysis
  - npm audit security checks

### Automated PR Review System
- **Trigger**: `check_suite` webhook with `conclusion: 'success'`
- **Process**: Comprehensive code review using Claude with GitHub CLI
- **Coverage**: Security, logic, performance, and code quality analysis
- **Output**: Line-specific comments and review decisions

### Code Quality Tools
- **ESLint** configuration for JavaScript/Node.js
- **Prettier** for consistent code formatting
- **Pre-commit hooks** for quality gates
- **Package.json** scripts for linting, formatting, and security

### Project Templates
- **Pull Request Template** with comprehensive checklist
- **Bug Report Template** with structured issue reporting
- **Feature Request Template** for new functionality requests
- **Dependabot Configuration** for automated dependency updates

### Documentation
- **CI/CD Setup Guide** (`docs/ci-cd-setup.md`)
- **Updated README** with status badges and CI information
- **Updated CLAUDE.md** with new CI/CD commands

### Testing Infrastructure
- **Check Suite Tests** for automated PR review functionality
- **Enhanced Test Coverage** for new webhook events
- **Test Environment** configuration for CI

## 🔒 Security Features

- **Dependency Scanning**: Daily vulnerability detection
- **Secret Scanning**: Repository-wide credential detection
- **SAST Analysis**: Static code analysis with CodeQL
- **Automated Updates**: Security patches via Dependabot

## 🏗️ Infrastructure

### Docker Integration
- **Multi-image builds**: Webhook service + Claude Code runner
- **Registry publishing**: GitHub Container Registry
- **Health checks**: Container validation in CI

### Quality Gates
- ✅ All tests must pass
- ✅ No linting violations
- ✅ Security scans clear
- ✅ Docker builds successful

## 📊 Test Coverage

```
File                       | % Stmts | % Branch | % Funcs | % Lines |
---------------------------|---------|----------|---------|---------|
All files                  |   58.98 |     63.8 |   71.42 |   59.33 |
 controllers               |   55.17 |    49.33 |      80 |   55.17 |
 services                  |   61.03 |    82.35 |      80 |   61.03 |

```

## 🧪 Testing

### New Test Coverage
- ✅ Check suite webhook event handling
- ✅ Automated PR review trigger logic
- ✅ Multiple PR scenarios
- ✅ Error handling for Claude service failures

### Known Test Issues
- AWS credential provider tests fail in test environment (expected)
- Tests pass in isolated environments with proper AWS setup

## 🚀 Deployment Pipeline

1. **Development**: Local development with pre-commit hooks
2. **CI**: Automated testing, linting, and security scans
3. **Build**: Docker image creation and registry publishing
4. **Staging**: Automatic deployment on main branch
5. **Production**: Manual approval with health checks

## 📋 Manual Setup Required

Due to GitHub token permissions, the following files need manual review/approval:

### GitHub Actions Workflows
- `.github/workflows/ci.yml` - Main CI pipeline
- `.github/workflows/security.yml` - Security scanning

### Configuration Files
- `.github/dependabot.yml` - Dependency updates
- `.eslintrc.js` - JavaScript linting rules
- `.prettierrc` - Code formatting standards

## 🔧 Local Development Commands

```bash
# Setup development environment
npm run setup:dev

# Run linting
npm run lint              # Auto-fix issues
npm run lint:check        # Check only

# Run formatting
npm run format            # Auto-format code
npm run format:check      # Check formatting

# Run tests
npm test                  # All tests
npm run test:unit         # Unit tests only
npm run test:coverage     # With coverage

# Security
npm run security:audit    # Check vulnerabilities
npm run security:fix      # Auto-fix issues
```
